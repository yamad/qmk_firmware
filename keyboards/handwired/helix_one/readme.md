Helix One
=========

This firmware is for the Helix One: an ortholinear 4x12 layout with 2 middle keys per hand. It is close to the layout of the Helix keyboard, but in a single piece similar to the Atreus.

This version is for a handwired version with an Arduino Pro Micro.

## Compiling and loading the firmware

To build the firmware, run `make`.

To flash the firemware onto the microcontroller, run `make avrdude`, and press the reset button.
